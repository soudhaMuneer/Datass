Stored Procedure
-----------------------
A stored procedure is a set of SQL commands that has been compiled and stored on the datatbase server.
Once the stored procedure has been stored,client applications can execute the stored procedure over and 
over again without sending it to the database server again and without compiling it again.
Stored procedures improve performance by reducing network traffic and CPU load.


Insert procedure:-

CREATE proc TS_Company_Master_Insert
(
@v_name as varchar(50),
@v_remarks as varchar(250)
)
as
declare @v_id as int
begin
select @v_id= (select isnull(max(id),0)+1 from TS_Company_Master)
insert into TS_Company_Master(id,name,remarks)
values (@v_id,@v_name,@v_remarks)
end
GO

exec TS_Company_Master_Insert 'OCH',''



Update Procedure:-

CREATE proc TS_Company_Master_Update
(
@v_id as int,
@v_name as varchar(50),
@v_remarks as varchar(250)
)
as
begin
update TS_Company_Master set name = @v_name,remarks = @v_remarks where id = @v_id
end
GO


exec TS_Company_Master_Update 5,'OCM',''



Delete Procedure:-

CREATE PROC [dbo].[deleteProc]
(
	@v_id int
	
) AS

BEGIN
		EXEC ('delete from '+'SP_table' + ' where '  +'id'+ '=' +@v_id)
END



EXEC deleteproc 5



create proc SelectProc2
(
@v_id int
)
AS

BEGIN
exec('Select * from SP_table where id=' + @v_id)
END

EXEC SelectProc2  4


CREATE proc SelectProc4
(
@v_tname varchar(50)
)
AS

BEGIN 
 exec('Select * From SP_table ' +@v_tname)
END


EXEC SelectProc4 'where name=''JAC'''





To Implement Optional Case

CREATE proc SelectProc6
(
@v_tname varchar(50)=NULL
)
AS


BEGIN
	exec('Select * From TS_Company_Master '+ @v_tname)

	END
GO
 EXEC SelectProc6


CREATE proc SelectProc8       ///Called a procedure within a procedure

AS


BEGIN
	EXEC SelectProc6

	END
GO

 EXEC SelectProc8
