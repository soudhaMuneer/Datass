Trigger
--------
Triggers are special types of Stored Procedures that are defined to execute automatically in place of or after data modifications. They can be executed automatically 
on the INSERT, DELETE and UPDATE triggering actions.

There are two different types of triggers in Microsoft SQL Server 2000. They are INSTEAD OF triggers and AFTER triggers. These triggers differ from each other in 
terms of their purpose and when they are fired.
