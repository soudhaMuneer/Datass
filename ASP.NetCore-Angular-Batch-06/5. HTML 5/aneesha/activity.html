        <h4>Requirements</h4>
        <p>Job requirements are the skills, education, experience, and traits that an employer expects someone to have to be successful in a job position ยน. These requirements describe what qualifications the employer is looking for in ideal candidates. Reviewing the job requirements can help you determine if you are a good fit for the position and select what skills, experience, and qualities to highlight in your resume and cover letter ยน.

            The most common job requirements include work experience, skills, education, professional licenses, accreditations, and certifications, specific knowledge, personal traits and attributes, languages, and physical ability ยน. Work experience is how much time you have spent in positions similar to the one you are applying for. Employers use this to determine how familiar you are with the role and how much training you have in the position or similar ones. Higher-level positions require more experience than entry-level roles because professionals usually gain more complex responsibilities the longer they work in an industry. Each position requires different skills to successfully complete the work. These include technical, soft, and hard skills. Technical skills include working with computers, such as computer programming,<br> technical writing, data analysis, and project management. Soft skills are those that involve working with people, like communication, critical thinking, leadership, and problem-solving.<br> Hard skills require job-specific training, such as working with industrial machinery and other technology.
            
            Please note that job requirements vary depending on the industry, how technical the work is, and how competitive the job market is ยน.
